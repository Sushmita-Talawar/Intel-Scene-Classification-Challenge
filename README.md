# Intel-Scene-Classification-Challenge

 Image dataset contains images belonging to 6 categories which are classified into train, test and prediction set. This project contains the use of models like Convolutional Neural Networks, MobileNet and Transfer Learning to predict the best accuracy to classify images into their respective categories. CNN is applied to analyze visual imagery in deep neural networks and also used in image recognition and processing that is specifically designed to process pixel data. CNN image classification takes an input image, process it and classify it under respective category. Technically, deep learning models to train and test, each input image will pass it through a series of convolution layers with filters, pooling, fully connected layers and apply softmax function to classify an object. Transfer learning is a popular approach in deep learning where we use the pre-trained model of VGG16 and tune the output parameters of the dense layer to get the desired output. Mobilenet as it is lightweight in its architecture. TensorFlowâ€™s fully trained model for Imagenet retrains just the last layer of the neural network on the dataset. Though this approach is not as powerful as a fully trained model, it can provide surprisingly high accuracy for most tasks that are related.
